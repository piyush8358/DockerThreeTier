# Project Documentation: Integration of Docker, MySQL, and WordPress

## Introduction:
This document presents a comprehensive overview and documentation of the project that showcases the seamless integration of Docker, MySQL, and WordPress. The project implements a three-tier architecture using Docker Compose, allowing for efficient deployment and management of the application stack.

## Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the power and convenience of using Docker to orchestrate the integration of MySQL and WordPress. By leveraging Docker's containerization capabilities, we can create a scalable and portable environment for web development.

## Architecture:
The project follows a three-tier architecture, consisting of the following components:

- MySQL: A containerized instance of MySQL is utilized as the database server. This allows for easy management and isolation of the database.

- WordPress: Another containerized instance is used to deploy the WordPress application. By containerizing WordPress, we achieve flexibility and portability, enabling seamless deployment across various environments.

- Docker Compose: Docker Compose is employed to define and manage the services required for this project. It provides a simple and efficient way to orchestrate multiple containers and their dependencies.

Implementation Steps:
The project was implemented in the following steps:

- Image Pull: The necessary Docker images for MySQL and WordPress were obtained from Docker Hub. These images provide a pre-configured environment for the respective components.

- Docker Compose File: A Docker Compose file was created to define the services, networks, and volumes required for the project. The Compose file serves as a blueprint for orchestrating the containers.

- Code Configuration: The Docker Compose file was populated with the necessary configuration parameters, such as database credentials, port mappings, and volume mounts. These parameters ensure proper communication and data persistence within the containerized environment.

- Container Deployment: With the Docker Compose file ready, the project was launched by executing the docker-compose up command. This command creates and starts the necessary containers according to the specified configuration.

- WordPress Configuration: After the WordPress container was successfully launched, the necessary details, such as site name, admin username, password, and database connection settings, were provided to set up the WordPress instance.

- Project Output:
Upon successful configuration of WordPress, the project was ready to use. The output consisted of a fully functional WordPress website, accessible through the defined port mapping. With this integration, users can leverage the power of Docker, MySQL, and WordPress to develop and deploy dynamic web applications seamlessly.


# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating Docker, MySQL, and WordPress to create a robust and scalable web development environment. By leveraging containerization, developers can easily set up and manage complex application stacks, enabling efficient collaboration and streamlined deployment. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the project's implementation and showcases the possibilities of this powerful trio.
